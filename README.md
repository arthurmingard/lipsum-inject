Lipsum Inject
=============
Release 1.0.1

**Really simply Lipsum injector**

******************************

Simple way to populate any dom element with random Lipsum

** Instructions **

- Add 'lipsum' as a class to each element you'd like to populate
- Append URL param with 'lipsuminject' to activate
- Available data params include:
> *data-lipsum-c* for character count
> *data-lipsum-w* for word count
> *data-lipsum-p* for paragraph count

Set a random value range by specifying multiple numbers e.g. 'data-lipsum-c="10-50"'
Word count and character count can be used together but if word count isn't set, a default of 35 words is applied.

*Release notes*

> [1.0.1] - 'Keep alive' forces ?lipsuminject on all links so that you don't need to append the URL each time
